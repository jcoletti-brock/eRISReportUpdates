- **Validating Requirements**: Ensure all technical terms are defined, scope boundaries are explicit, and assumptions are documented.
- **Research and Validation**: Use web research to validate technical approaches, industry standards, and realistic timelines.
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Ask clarifying questions and flag concerns early to ensure alignment.
