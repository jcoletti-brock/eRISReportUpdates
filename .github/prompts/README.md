# Prompts

Prompts are requests that we make to an agent to have it perform a task.
Prompts should be written explicitly with the expected steps detailed as clearly as possible.

The biggest challenge we see is that most individuals don't realize how much detail you need to give an agent to get it to perform a moderately complex task in a repeatable manner.

In the context of prompts we want to focus on repeatability.

> NOTE: It is common for your prompt to have the exact code, content, script ..etc you want the agent to use when completing the task.

They go in this folder `.github/prompts/`, and need to follow the format `<name>.prompt.md.

In the chat window use `/` to bring up the prompt selector.
