# AgentKit

*Tool oriented approach to simplify GitHub Copilot agent creation with templates.*

**AgentKit is a CLI tool that helps you bootstrap GitHub Copilot agent files from pre-configured templates, bringing best practices and role-specific guidance to your development workflow.**

## What is AgentKit?

AgentKit provides an interactive CLI that helps you generate customized GitHub Copilot agent files from templates.

Instead of manually creating agent configurations from scratch, you answer a few questions and get a ready-to-use `.prompt.md` file that you can use with the GitHub Copilot of your choosing to create a tailored Copilot agent that meets our standards, and the specific configuration / needs of your project.

### Key Features

- **Pre-built Templates** - Growing list of role-specific agent templates
- **Interactive Setup** - Answer guided prompts to customize agents for your specific requirements
- **Best Practices Built-in** - Templates include role-specific documentation, coding standards, and workflow guidance
