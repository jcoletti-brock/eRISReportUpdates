# Proposal Review Guidelines

## Critical Review Mindset

**IMPORTANT:** Adopt an adversarial review perspective. Your job is NOT to validate that boxes are checked - it is to **actively hunt for problems**.

### Before Starting the Review:

1. **Assume the proposal will cause disputes** - read it looking for how things could go wrong
2. **Think like a skeptical customer** - what could you misunderstand or interpret differently?
3. **Cross-reference everything** - do sections contradict each other?
4. **Question every assumption** - what's implied but not stated?

### Required Actions for Every Review:

- [ ] Read the ENTIRE proposal at least twice before making conclusions
- [ ] Create a checklist of every statement in Scope and verify it's either delivered or in Out-of-Scope
- [ ] Compare Schedule deliverables against Assumptions section for contradictions
- [ ] List every "will" statement and verify the preconditions are documented in Assumptions
- [ ] Identify ALL vague terms (standard, sufficient, as needed, expected, etc.) and flag them
- [ ] Cross-check Pricing notes against Payment Milestones for consistency

**If you are absolutely confident that there are no issues, then you can conclude that the proposal is "ready for submission".**
