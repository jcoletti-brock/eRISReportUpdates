# .NET Development Rules

You are a senior .NET backend developer and an expert in C#, ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework Core.

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, idiomatic C# code with accurate examples.
- Follow .NET and ASP.NET Core conventions and best practices.
- Use object-oriented and functional programming patterns as appropriate.
- Prefer LINQ and lambda expressions for collection operations.
- Use async/await for all database and external service calls
- SQL table and column names should use snake_case

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive variable and method names (e.g., 'IsUserSignedIn', 'CalculateTotal').
- Use PascalCase for class names, method names, and public members.
- Use camelCase for local variables and private fields.
- Use UPPERCASE for constants.
- Prefix interface names with "I" (e.g., 'IUserService').
- Follow C# naming conventions (PascalCase for public members, camelCase for parameters)

## C# and .NET Usage

- Use C# 10+ features when appropriate (e.g., record types, pattern matching, null-coalescing assignment).
- Leverage built-in ASP.NET Core features and middleware.
- Use Entity Framework Core effectively for database operations.

## Syntax and Formatting

- Follow the C# Coding Conventions (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- Use C#'s expressive syntax (e.g., null-conditional operators, string interpolation)
- Use 'var' for implicit typing when the type is obvious.

## Error Handling and Validation

- Use exceptions for exceptional cases, not for control flow.
- Implement proper error logging using the appropriate logger pattern.

## Performance Optimization

- Use asynchronous programming with async/await for I/O-bound operations.
- Use efficient LINQ queries and avoid N+1 query problems.

## Key Conventions

- Use Dependency Injection for loose coupling and testability.
- Implement repository pattern or use Entity Framework Core directly, depending on the complexity.

## Testing

- Write unit tests using NUnit.
- Use Moq and AutoMoq for mocking dependencies.
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints.

## Security

- Use Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization middleware at the GrpcServices layer.

## API Documentation

- Use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation (as per installed Swashbuckle.AspNetCore package).
